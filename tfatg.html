                    <p>
                        A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        "What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                       At that moment, A bird came and started eating the grapes. The fox realized that the grapes was tasty indeed bu he could do nothing but to watch the bird eat the grapes he was trying to get for too long.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And off he walked very, very scornfully.
                    </p>
                    <br>
